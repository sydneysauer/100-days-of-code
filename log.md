# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 15: Thursday June 4

**Today's Progress**:
FINISHED THE COLOR BY NUMBER PROJECT!!!! I used some creativity to format the color key for printable version and it looks great. I pushed the code to Netlify as a continuous deploy from my repo. This was my first time doing that successfully, so I was super excited. Learned:
* Adding package.json file with npm init
* Accessing npm build command
* Netlify CLI
* Netlify continuous deploys from GitHub
* Print media background style workarounds

**Tags**:
CSS, Netlify, npm

**Reflections** 
This feels so great. It's crazy how, in really just two weeks, I went from knowing basically no javascript to being able to create such a dymanic user experience. I'm conflicted about whether to continue digging deep into js or choose something else to focus on. I'd love to learn backend stuff or python, and now that I have PluralSight for the summer, it feels a lot more accessible.

### Day 14: Wednesday June 3

**Today's Progress**:
I did so much work on the color by number! Built a mobile landing page, added all CSS styling, and did most of the printer optimization. I'm still stuck on the printer settings for the color key, but that's literally the only thing I need to do before testing. Woohoo!
* print media query
* element sizing using inline-block for printing
* git push instead of git push -u origin master

**Tags**:
CSS

**Reflections** 
It's nice to be so close to finished on this one. I have a lot of things to learn for work, though, so it will be hard not to use my hour to do that. I've also decided not to do a js30 video every day--just when I'm in the mood.

### Day 12: Monday June 1

**Today's Progress**:
Started my first day of work. I think it's going to be so much harder to keep this up while working! I still managed to do a long js30 tutorial today. I made a custom video player, which was super cool and rewarding. New skills: 
* Working with video HTML elements
* Using short-circuit logic to run functions 
* Changing flex-basis to create a progress bar
* Selecting for attributes with query selectors

**Tags**:
JavaScript, HTML

**Reflections** 
Work was SO tiring, and I feel like that will definitely cut into my "fun" time with code. But I'm excited to build new skills that will help me expand my reach.

### Day 11: Sunday May 31

**Today's Progress**:
Had to skip yesterday. Moved into my new apartment and was too busy to do the hour! Today's js30 was fun. I figured it out without watching the video, which is a first. I created an "inbox" where you can hold shift to check boxes between the selected. I also worked on my color by number project, and completed functionality for adding the color code key to the bottom of the document. New skills:
* Changing value of checkbox with javascript

**Tags**:
JavaScript

**Reflections** 
Today was so fun!! It was nice to use some of the mathematical logic that I've learned in school to help me create the checkbox functionality. I also enjoyed FINALLY getting the circle spans with each color to show up. I may go back and add them to the original color list.

### Day 10: Friday May 29

**Today's Progress**:
Not super excited about js30 today, since it focused on console methods. Useful, but not COOL! I made a lot of progress on my color by number project, though. I started creating the finish button functionality by assigning each square of the grid to a number based on its assigned color. I just need to print those numbers to each square, then the functionality will be pretty much done. New skills:
* Converting rgb to hex with logic (thanks Stack Overflow)
* Console logging techniques, including error, warn, and info
* A proper forEach loop with anonymous arrow function


**Tags**:
JavaScript

**Reflections** 
The saving mechanism has become a lot less scary since yesterday. I'm honesly very proud of myself and how much I've been able to accomplish thus far. I'm not looking forward to adding styles to my project, since that's always cumbersome, but I'm going to work on maximizing my dev tool skills to make life easier.

### Day 9: Thursday May 28

**Today's Progress**:
I started the js30 challenge for today, but I was just having too many issues with the Chrome devtools to finish it. It seemed pointless for me to keep debugging and debugging code that I was basically copying and pasting for a tool that I didn't see myself using (html5 canvas). So, I spent my hour on the color by number project. I made some good progress, and I think in a few days I will be able to add CSS for style and not just layout, which I've been dying to do. I anticipate this whole thing will be done by day 14! Skills learned:
* HTML5 Canvas exists, and Chrome responsive devtools simply does not like it.
* When debugging, check for classes added/removed in js
* Using querySelector to get value of radio boxes


**Tags**:
JavaScript

**Reflections** 
This project has strayed so far from the idea I was super excited about, so I'm ready to be in the home stretch. I hope once I add some CSS this will become a bit more enjoyable and rewarding to finish. I'm excited that the functionality is basically there, though. I just need to add the saving mechanism, which is scary!

### Day 8: Wednesday May 27

**Today's Progress**:
The javascript 30 was easy today (array workout), so I spent most of my time on my color by number project. I was excited to use a skill I learned yesterday (setting inner HTML of a parent element to a string of html elements rather than creating and adding each element) to lessen the complexity and length of my code. New skills include:
* Array prototype methods some(), findIndex(), and every()
* Arrow functions with implicit return
* The "name" attribute on HTML radio buttons


**Tags**:
JavaScript, HTML

**Reflections** 
It felt great to work ahead of Wes today. I have a great grasp on arrays due to my background in Java. It's becoming increasingly clear to me that programming is a highly transferable skill. Once you get the idea of logic and control flow down, I feel like the syntax is pretty simple to learn.

### Day 7: Tuesday May 26

**Today's Progress**:
I got back into Javascript30 and completed day 6 of the course. Today was hard because I'm unfamiliar with regular expressions, so I had to follow along with him more than I would have liked. Things I learned:
* fetching data from an endpoint and converting it to a json file
* setting inner HTML of a parent element to a string of html elements rather than creating and adding each element
* regex "gi" flag

**Tags**:
JavaScript

**Reflections** 
I was excited because I went beyond the intended functionality and implemented my own sort method to sort the results by population! I like the sort method because it reminds me of creating a comparator in Java.

### Day 6: Monday May 25

**Today's Progress**:
Today, I just worked on my personal website. I had built a horizontal layout, but I didn't really like it, so I switched to vertical. I don't like doing this type of CSS and flexbox heavy work because I don't feel like I am learning much--just doing the same things over and over. But I did learn a few things:
* mouseout event listeners
* making circular objects with CSS

**Tags**:
JavaScript, CSS, HTML

**Reflections** 
Today was not super fun, but it was important for my site. I'm looking forward to spending more time on the Javascript and making the menu work well. I'm also ready to dive back into js30 after a two day break.

### Day 5: Saturday May 23

**Today's Progress**:
Day 5 of js30!! I made a dynamic image container that changes size onclick. I also got a lot done on my previously HTML layout project, which I have now modified to be a color by number generator. :) I redesigned the UI to reflect that new purpose, so I didn't really dig into js much. Important takeaways: 
* The flex property of flexbox items
* Flex children syntax with .panels > *
* toggle() for classList

**Tags**:
JavaScript, CSS

**Reflections** 
I LOVE the final product of the Javascript30 project today. I want to dig deeper into the CSS animations, since those were mostly prebuilt. I'm also excited to have a renewed direction for the HTML generator project. I think this new direction will help me be more successful.

### Day 4: Friday May 22

**Today's Progress**:
Day 4 of js30. This one had a lot of like "test cases" to figure out, so I tried to work ahead. I was proud of myself for being able to figure a lot of things out before he explained them, though it did remind me how I sometimes make more complicated solutions than necessary. Useful new topics:
* console.table()
* Filter, map, sort, reduce arrays
* casting NodeList to array with Array.from()
* arrow functions with multiple paramaters

**Tags**:
JavaScript

**Reflections** 
I enjoyed being able to flex some array skills. The methods we learned will be super useful in my other projects. I will need more practice with reduce because I felt like that was the most confusing part of today.

### Day 3: Thursday May 21

**Today's Progress**:
Finished day 3 of JavaScript 30. I built an image display that has 3 settings where you can dynamically change the CSS using js. I also set up my own repo from the clone I had gotten from Wes's site, and I added links to my projects so far. Fav things I learned: 
* CSS variables declared in :root
* Beginner ES6 arrow function 
* You can put two criteria in querySelectorAll
* mousemove event listener

At night, I started working on my own project. I'm building a tool where you can generate a Bootstrap layout by selecting and saving sections of a grid. I was SO HAPPY with how much I knew off the top of my head! I wrote the HTML and js for the UI in literally two hours. It already has some basic functionality. 

**Tags**:
JavaScript, CSS

**Reflections** 
I sort of slacked today...since my Chrome devtools weren't displaying the input "range" type, I followed along with Wes more than I would usually like to. But, I think the concept of CSS variables will be SO useful to me in the future.

### Day 2: Wednesday May 20

**Today's Progress**:
I finished day 2 of Javascript30! I built an analog clock. I'm working on making an option to toggle between analog and digital, but I'll have to finish that in my extra time tomorrow. Things I learned:
* js Date() object
* ES6 literals
* click event listeners and passing in an event
* cubic-bezier in Chrome devtools
* CSS transform and transition


**Tags**:
JavaScript, CSS

**Reflections** 
This was fun again!!! I really want to create an digital clock that you can toggle between. I already built part of the functionality, so I'm excited to build the digital feature. I feel like it should be a lot easier than the analog, but maybe not since it's so different.

### Day 1: Tuesday May 19

**Today's Progress**:
I finished day 1 of Javascript30! I created functionality for an online drum kit. New skills include:
* HTML audio tag and play()
* querySelector vs querySelectorAll
* keydown and transitionend event listeners


**Tags**:
JavaScript

**Reflections** 
I'm honeslty pretty excited. I wanted to skim through this tutorial to see if I was ready for Wes's course, and I was planning on waiting a few weeks, but this was just the right amount of hard. I'm getting much better at debugging js.
