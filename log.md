# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 3: Thursday May 21

**Today's Progress**:
Finished day 3 of JavaScript 30. I built an image display that has 3 settings where you can dynamically change the CSS using js. Fav things I learned: 
* CSS variables declared in :root
* Beginner ES6 arrow function 
* You can put two criteria in querySelectorAll
* mousemove event listener


**Tags**:
JavaScript, CSS

**Reflections** 
I sort of slacked today...since my Chrome devtools weren't displaying the input "range" type, I followed along with Wes more than I would usually like to. But, I think the concept of CSS variables will be SO useful to me in the future.

### Day 2: Wednesday May 20

**Today's Progress**:
I finished day 2 of Javascript30! I built an analog clock. I'm working on making an option to toggle between analog and digital, but I'll have to finish that in my extra time tomorrow. Things I learned:
* js Date() object
* ES6 literals
* click event listeners and passing in an event
* cubic-bezier in Chrome devtools
* CSS transform and transition


**Tags**:
JavaScript, CSS

**Reflections** 
This was fun again!!! I really want to create an digital clock that you can toggle between. I already built part of the functionality, so I'm excited to build the digital feature. I feel like it should be a lot easier than the analog, but maybe not since it's so different.

### Day 1: Tuesday May 19

**Today's Progress**:
I finished day 1 of Javascript30! I created functionality for an online drum kit. New skills include:
* HTML audio tag and play()
* querySelector vs querySelectorAll
* keydown and transitionend event listeners


**Tags**:
JavaScript

**Reflections** 
I'm honeslty pretty excited. I wanted to skim through this tutorial to see if I was ready for Wes's course, and I was planning on waiting a few weeks, but this was just the right amount of hard. I'm getting much better at debugging js.
