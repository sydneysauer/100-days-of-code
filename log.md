# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 5: Saturday May 23

**Today's Progress**:
Day 5 of js30!! I made a dynamic image container that changes size onclick. I also got a lot done on my previously HTML layout project, which I have now modified to be a color by number generator. :) I redesigned the UI to reflect that new purpose, so I didn't really dig into js much. Important takeaways: 
* The flex property of flexbox items
* Flex children syntax with .panels > *
* toggle() for classList

**Tags**:
JavaScript, CSS

**Reflections** 
I LOVE the final product of the Javascript30 project today. I want to dig deeper into the CSS animations, since those were mostly prebuilt. I'm also excited to have a renewed direction for the HTML generator project. I think this new direction will help me be more successful.

### Day 4: Friday May 22

**Today's Progress**:
Day 4 of js30. This one had a lot of like "test cases" to figure out, so I tried to work ahead. I was proud of myself for being able to figure a lot of things out before he explained them, though it did remind me how I sometimes make more complicated solutions than necessary. Useful new topics:
* console.table()
* Filter, map, sort, reduce arrays
* casting NodeList to array with Array.from()
* arrow functions with multiple paramaters

**Tags**:
JavaScript

**Reflections** 
I enjoyed being able to flex some array skills. The methods we learned will be super useful in my other projects. I will need more practice with reduce because I felt like that was the most confusing part of today.

### Day 3: Thursday May 21

**Today's Progress**:
Finished day 3 of JavaScript 30. I built an image display that has 3 settings where you can dynamically change the CSS using js. I also set up my own repo from the clone I had gotten from Wes's site, and I added links to my projects so far. Fav things I learned: 
* CSS variables declared in :root
* Beginner ES6 arrow function 
* You can put two criteria in querySelectorAll
* mousemove event listener

At night, I started working on my own project. I'm building a tool where you can generate a Bootstrap layout by selecting and saving sections of a grid. I was SO HAPPY with how much I knew off the top of my head! I wrote the HTML and js for the UI in literally two hours. It already has some basic functionality. 

**Tags**:
JavaScript, CSS

**Reflections** 
I sort of slacked today...since my Chrome devtools weren't displaying the input "range" type, I followed along with Wes more than I would usually like to. But, I think the concept of CSS variables will be SO useful to me in the future.

### Day 2: Wednesday May 20

**Today's Progress**:
I finished day 2 of Javascript30! I built an analog clock. I'm working on making an option to toggle between analog and digital, but I'll have to finish that in my extra time tomorrow. Things I learned:
* js Date() object
* ES6 literals
* click event listeners and passing in an event
* cubic-bezier in Chrome devtools
* CSS transform and transition


**Tags**:
JavaScript, CSS

**Reflections** 
This was fun again!!! I really want to create an digital clock that you can toggle between. I already built part of the functionality, so I'm excited to build the digital feature. I feel like it should be a lot easier than the analog, but maybe not since it's so different.

### Day 1: Tuesday May 19

**Today's Progress**:
I finished day 1 of Javascript30! I created functionality for an online drum kit. New skills include:
* HTML audio tag and play()
* querySelector vs querySelectorAll
* keydown and transitionend event listeners


**Tags**:
JavaScript

**Reflections** 
I'm honeslty pretty excited. I wanted to skim through this tutorial to see if I was ready for Wes's course, and I was planning on waiting a few weeks, but this was just the right amount of hard. I'm getting much better at debugging js.
