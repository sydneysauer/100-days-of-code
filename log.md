# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tuesday May 19

**Today's Progress**:
I finished day 1 of Javascript30! I created functionality for an online drum kit. New skills include:
* HTML audio tag and play()
* querySelector vs querySelectorAll
* keydown and transitionend event listeners


**Tags**:
JavaScript

**Reflections** 
I'm honeslty pretty excited. I wanted to skim through this tutorial to see if I was ready for Wes's course, and I was planning on waiting a few weeks, but this was just the right amount of hard. I'm getting much better at debugging js.
